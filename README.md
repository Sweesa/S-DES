# S-DES
A C# implementation of Simplified-DES. The algorithm was created by Edward Schaefer, Professor of Mathematics at Santa Clara University. It has fewer parameters than DES and is less complex, but is a good resource for understanding how DES encrypts text.

This implementation was not written to be an optimal solution, but rather was made to be easy to follow with the different elements of the alogorithm being separated into small logical components.
