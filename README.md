# S-DES
A C# implementation of the Simplified version DES. The algorithm was created by Edward Schaefer, Professor of Mathematics at Santa Clara University. It has fewer parameters than DES and is less complex, but is a good resource for unsterstanding the underlying principles in DES.

This implementation is not an optimal implementation, it was written to be easy to digest with the different elements being seperated into their smallest logical components.
